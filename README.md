# Machine-Learning-for-Diabete-Prediction-
In this project, I applied data analysis and machine learning techniques to build predictive models for diabetes diagnosis. I started by performing univariate and bivariate analysis on the variables in the dataset, including handling extreme values and outliers. Then, I split the data into training and testing sets and normalized the data.

I then built and compared several machine learning models, including Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and a deep learning model using TensorFlow. I also fine-tuned the Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression models using grid search to optimize their hyperparameters.
